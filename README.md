# Justin's 2025 Developer Roadmap

### Description

The goal of this document is to begin plotting skills and proficiencies within each area. This will include sections such as [#Cloud](#Cloud) or [#DevOps](#DevOps). This document will most certainly change as the year goes on, goals that weren't originally planned may be included and marked off on the same day, or they may never be checked off due to time constraints or other factors.

But, I want to know what I am striving for, what I have thrived in, and how I was able to succeed.

When an object is checked off the list I hope to include a brief synopsis of where the achievement came from. This could be as detailed as an overview of how where I can find resources to review what I have previously learned or something as simple as a one line summary.

Some sections may also include a reasoning, outlining why I wanted to do something or what I was hoping to gain. They may even have a link to there own document for more in depth goals.

Finally, there will be one major goal. It will be more abstract but it will encapsulate my hopes for the year.
